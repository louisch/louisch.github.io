                <p>I am an undergraduate at <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Imperial College London</a>, studying Computing.</p>
                <p>I quite enjoy functional programming, and would probably enjoy object oriented programming as well, as long as I wasn't doing it in Java.</p>
                <p>I have experience mostly in C, Java and Python. Recently, I have had some experience in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, though I do not have very deep knowledge of it, and am mostly at the stage of "if I do this, Rails will do that". I have also recently started learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> by solving challenges on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler.</a></p>
